## üß† How It Works

1. User enters product details in the input fields
2. Clicking `Create` will:
   - Add the product(s) to the list
   - Save them in `localStorage`
3. All saved products are listed in the table below
4. Users can:
   - Click `Update` to modify a product
   - Click `Delete` to remove a product
   - Use search to filter by title or category
